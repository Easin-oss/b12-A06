var, let, const → var is function-scoped, let and const are block-scoped.

map(), forEach(), filter() → map returns new array, forEach iterates, filter selects elements.

Arrow functions → Shorter syntax, no own this, implicit return possible.

Destructuring assignment → Extract values from arrays/objects directly into variables easily.

Template literals → Use backticks, allow interpolation and multiline, unlike concatenation.
